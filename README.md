# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This app is an assignment for a senior mobile developer using React native, I implemented an architecture that should be closer to a real-world application

# Lets take a quick walk throw the file structure 


    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ api             # this handles the API requests, in our case I used Axios but in future we can add more middleware like GraphQL for example
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ axios       # exports the axios instance with the custom configrations for the requests and response 
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index       # Export the general 'callAPI' function which serves as an abstraction layer so we can chnge axios any time and by simply change this function or add more options to it
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types       # Contains the types that are required for this folder
    â”œâ”€â”€ services        # This folder have the Api calls that need for each app module its an abstraction over the API layer

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
